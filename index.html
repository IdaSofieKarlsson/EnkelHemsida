            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>I like being in charge of the administration, it suits me to be in the center of things, dealing with contractors, helping out 
                the shareholders and charming investors and other VIPs. I’m used to be self-leading, working under pressure with a multitude 
                of parallel commitments and I usually managed my own time. My main contribution to the workplace is my drive, my discipline, 
                and my composure. It is important for me to deliver, that everything flows and I always strive to have full control of the 
                office.</p>
